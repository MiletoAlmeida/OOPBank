# OOPBank

OOPBank is a simple banking application that allows users to register and login. It is built using Java, Spring Boot, and Maven.
The application is a simple demonstration of object-oriented programming concepts in Java. It is a work in progress and will be updated with more features.

The OOPBank (Or Oriented Object Programming Bank) is a personal project that I am working on to improve my Java skills. I am using this project to learn more about Java. 
In the first version, It was a simple console application with only Java and Maven, where it was possible to:
- Create an account
- Login
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Transfer
- Check balance
- Check account information
- Check transaction history
- Invest

An analysis of the project was made, and it was decided to improve it. To check the analysis, click [here](https://gilyssabrt.notion.site/Mileto-15616b375d0e80f49e86f2d2fc56c160).

In the second version, I am using Spring Boot to improve the project and make it more professional. I am also using the MVC pattern to separate the layers of the application.
The project is still in progress, and I am working on it in my free time. I am also learning more about Spring Boot and the MVC pattern, so in the future the other features will be implemented.
